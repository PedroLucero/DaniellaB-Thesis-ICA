# daniella_tesis_app

Daniella's app. This is pretty epic.

## BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT???

Basically a tracker for diabetes patients. This project has served as an absolutely excellent opportunity to learn flutter's kit. Plus it is a proof of concept for her thesis!

By no means is this finished right now...

Note: There's a lot of folders that Flutter creates when starting a new project. These are large hence I won't upload them. They are: .dart_tool/, .idea/, android/, build/, ios/, linux/, macos/, windows/

- I'm not sure if adding them (I got a large file warning)
- I'm a lil' confused since I pushed them to newAdds yet got no warning... perhaps I do keep them...?
